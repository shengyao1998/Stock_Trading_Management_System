#### Issue Encountered

##### 1. Different Betweek Functional and Non-Functional Requirement (GeeksforGeeks, 2023)
**Functional Features** <br>
These are the requirements that the end user specifically demands as basic facilities that the system should offer. All these functionalities need to be necessarily incorporated into the system as a part of the contract. These are represented or stated in the form of input to be given to the system, the operation performed and the output expected. They are basically the requirements stated by the user which one can see directly in the final product, unlike the non-functional requirements.

**Non-Functional Features** <br>
These are basically the quality constraints that the system must satisfy according to the project contract. The priority or extent to which these factors are implemented varies from one project to other. They are also called non-behavioral requirements.

##### 2. What is API (G2, Bridget Poetker, 2022)
Application programming interfaces (APIs) make software development and innovation easier by allowing programs to communicate data and functions safely and quickly. APIs accelerate innovation because more developers can build products based on existing data and functionality.
